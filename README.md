# Real Estate Price Prediction Model- A Machine Learning Project
For the solution of the project I analyzed the problem from collecting the data importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more.
In the end created a robust price prediction model based on the previous data which improved the accuracy of predictions.
Implemented a variety of supervised learning algorithms to find the best-performing one, Random Forest Regression while model building.
